# SocialMediaAnalytics

This independent study project was undertaken to determine the impact of social media on companies that launch ICO campaigns. ICO's or Initial Coin Offerings are unregulated means for startups to raise funds by asking investors to trade funds with tokens. The investors depend on the whitepaper that the startups provie and also on the word-of-mouth and social media influence/sentiment of the company. 

Once the company finishes it's ICO campaign, it is vital that the company sustains its social media presence and tries to interact with its customers. In this study, we try to understand the following factors with respect to social media presence of a company post its ICO campaign.

1) What is the sentiment of the company - positive, negative, weakly positive, weakly negative, neutral and so on. 
2) What do the tweets of the company focus on ? what are the frequent words ? what are the frequent hashtags ?
3) Using the Search API, what kind of analysis can we achieve ? What is the social reach of each tweet ? 
4) What are the number of likes, count of followers, user mentions of the tweet ?

## Social Media Matrix

Using the above data and the analysis methods, we devise a social media matrix that identifies the major metrics which we can use to determine the performance of a company in its post-ICO campaign market. The metrics are: 

* Frequency
* Social Reach
* Interaction and Response rate
* Sentiment
* Engagement Levels
* Referral Traffic
* Community Size
* Share of Voice
