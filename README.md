# SocialMediaAnalytics

This independent study project was undertaken to determine the impact of social media on companies that launch ICO campaigns. ICO's or Initial Coin Offerings are unregulated means for startups to raise funds by asking investors to trade funds with tokens. The investors depend on the whitepaper that the startups provie and also on the word-of-mouth and social media influence/sentiment of the company.
